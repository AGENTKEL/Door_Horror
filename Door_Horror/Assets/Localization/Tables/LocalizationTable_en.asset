      several months. He believes he\u2019s just playing a children\u2019s game.
      Maybe it\u2019s for the best.\r\nIf the patient leaves this room and keeps
      sinking deeper into himself, his mind will never return to its former state,
      and we\u2019ll have to disconnect him from all life support.\r\n"
